Using the memory tools provided with VAST and the extensions included in this project, developers can quickly diagnose and correct memory problems.

## Installation

### Dependencies

Using the "Configuration Maps Browser", you first need to load the configuration map `ENVY/Stats ES-ALL` that ships with your VAST ENVY manager.


### Installation via Tonel

1. Install [VA Smalltalk 9.2.1 or newer](https://www.instantiations.com/products/vasmalltalk/download.html).
2. Install Tonel support in your development image following [this guide](https://github.com/vasmalltalk/tonel-vast#installation).
3. Clone this repository.
4. The easiest and recommended approach is to install it via a script:

```smalltalk
| loader path |
path := (CfsPath named: '<insert path to root kes-stats local repo here>').
loader := TonelLoader readFromPath: path.
loader
	beUnattended; "do not prompt and use all defaults"
	useGitVersion.
loader loadAllMapsWithRequiredMaps.
```

Or you can load the Configuration Map `KES/Stats` from the context menu of the Configuration Maps Browser: `"Import"` -> `"Load Configuration Maps from Tonel repository..."` -> select path to root `kes-stats` local repo. This will open a dialog and will use convenient defaults for the load. Refer to [its documentation](https://github.com/instantiations/tonel-vast#using-gui-menus) for more details.


### Installation via ENVY

1. Using the "Configuration Maps Browser", import and load the config map `KES/Stats` from the [kesStats.dat](envy/kesStats.dat)




## Getting Started

This extension of the applications in the `ENVY/Stats ES-ALL` configuration map summarizes the object statistics in memory and allows you to easily see what kinds of objects were relinquished between two measurements by simple selection.

To start, select `Open Memory Consumption Monitor` or `Open Static Memory Consumption View`
from the Tools menu of the Transcript.

The first view generates approximate snapshots of all objects in memory.  By selecting two
snapshots, you can compare the difference in new/discarded objects.

The second view shows the memory usage of the code for the selected applications.
